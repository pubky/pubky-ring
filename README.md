# Troubleshooting

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

# üîê Verifying Releases

Ensure your `app-release.apk` is authentic and untampered by verifying its **GPG signature** and **SHA256 checksum**.

### 1. Import the Maintainer's GPG Key

```bash
gpg --import public-key.asc
```

### 2. Verify the APK Signature

```bash
gpg --verify app-release.apk.asc app-release.apk
```

### 3. Verify the Checksum

```bash
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```
