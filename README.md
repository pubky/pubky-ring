# Getting Started

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pubky/pubky-ring && cd pubky-ring
```

### Install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
# For iOS you may also need the following:
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```
### Run the Application

**For iOS:**
```bash
yarn ios
```

**For Android:**
```bash
yarn android
```
If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

# Troubleshooting

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

# üîê Verifying Releases

Ensure your `app-release.apk` is authentic and untampered by verifying its **GPG signature** and **SHA256 checksum**.

### 1. Import the Maintainer's GPG Key

```bash
gpg --import public-key.asc
```

### 2. Verify the APK Signature

```bash
gpg --verify app-release.apk.asc app-release.apk
```

### 3. Verify the Checksum

```bash
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

## E2E testing (Appium + WebdriverIO)

This project includes Appium/WebdriverIO E2E tests for Android emulators and iOS simulators.

Prerequisites:
- Xcode with an iOS Simulator (e.g., "iPhone 15").
- Android SDK with an AVD (e.g., "Pixel_7_Pro_API_35").
- Java JDK 17+ and Node.js 18+.

Install drivers (one-time):

```bash
npm run e2e:drivers
```

Build the apps:
- Android APK (Debug):
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```
- iOS app (Debug) for simulator:
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace ios/pubkyring.xcworkspace -scheme pubkyring -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath ios/build
```

Run tests:
- Android:
```bash
npm run e2e:android
```
- iOS:
```bash
npm run e2e:ios
```

Environment overrides:
- ANDROID_APP: absolute path to the .apk
- AVD: Android Virtual Device name (e.g., Pixel_6_API_34)
- ANDROID_DEVICE_NAME / ANDROID_PLATFORM_VERSION
- APP_PACKAGE / APP_ACTIVITY (defaults: to.pubky.ring / .MainActivity)
- IOS_APP: absolute path to the .app
- IOS_SIM / IOS_PLATFORM_VERSION
- IOS_BUNDLE_ID (default: app.pubkyring)

Examples:

```bash
# Android (provide APK)
ANDROID_APP=/absolute/path/app-debug.apk npm run e2e:android

# Android (attach to installed app on an emulator)
AVD=Pixel_6_API_34 npm run e2e:android

# iOS (provide .app)
IOS_APP=/absolute/path/pubkyring.app npm run e2e:ios

# iOS (attach to installed app on a simulator)
IOS_SIM="iPhone 15" npm run e2e:ios
```
